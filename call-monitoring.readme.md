 When the view loads. The application makes a rest call to a getthat rest end point to retreive a list of agents. This list of agents is then looped over (At this point, knowlarity does not provide a feature to accept an array of numbers) , each loop makes 
 a rest call using the agents [knolarity](https://www.knowlarity.com/) number as paramter to fetch the agents call logs. when all call logs have been recieved for all
 agents. the list of call logs is dispatched and rendered on the UI.
